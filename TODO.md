# Things To Do
 * Implement Generic Classes implementing the various interfaces
 * Write unit tests
 * Hook up to travis and other code monitoring services
 * Implement a separate package illustrating how to implement Owner, User and Group level permission enforcement
 * Check other stuff in my other projects that could be of value in this one
 * Update class diagram once package is stable
 * Move interface method implementions in generic classes out into traits once they have been thoroughly tested 
 and are working as expected.
 * Document using this package using acl examples from existing application and even using examples from the zend packages.
    * Add guidelines on how to customize this package to suit various requirements like the 
    Owner, User and Group level permission enforcement described above.   
 * Submit to packagist once it's well done.
