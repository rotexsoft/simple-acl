# Things To Do
 * Implement Generic Classes implementing the various interfaces
 * Write unit tests
 * Hook up to travis and other code monitoring services
 * Implement a separate package illustrating how to implement Owner, User and Group level permission enforcement
 * Check other stuff in my other projects that could be of value in this one
 * Update class diagram once package is stable
